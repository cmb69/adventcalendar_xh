<p>
    Adventcalendar_XH facilitates to display an advent
    calendar on your site. The little doors can only be opened by visitors up to the
    current date. The secrets behind the doors are the contents of CMSimple_XH
    pages, so it's possible to present whatever you like (poetry, images, videos,
    products etc.)

    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Adventcalendar</i>.

</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    You can have as much separate advent calendars in a CMSimple_XH installation
    as you like. These are distinguished by a name. The name may contain
    alphanumeric characters only and it should not be the same as the heading of
    any already existing page.
</p>
<p>
    Visitors of your site will not be able to open doors of future days,
    according to the configuration option <i>Date</i> → <i>Start</i>. When
    you're logged in as administrator you can access all doors for testing
    purposes.
</p>

<section id="usage-quickstart">
<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
<p>
    To quickly set up a working demo, just follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Navigate to <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Adventcalendar</i> → <i>Main Settings</i>
    and press <i>Prepare Cover</i>.
</li>
<li>
    Create a new hidden CMSimple_XH page with the heading "winter" (letter case
    is important) and without content.
</li>
<li>
    Create some hidden subpages of this page with arbitrary headings and
    content.
</li>
<li>
    Enter the following plugin call on another page:
    <pre>{{{adventcalendar('winter')}}}</pre>
</li>
<li>
    Switch to view mode and enjoy the advent calendar. Note, that you can only
    open as much doors, as you have created subpages of the calendar page.
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="usage-cover">
<h3>Prepare the Cover</h3>
<p>
    Find an appropriate background image for your advent calendar, resize it to
    the desired size (typically the width of the contents area of your template)
    and upload it to the configured data folder of the plugin. The uploaded
    image has to be in JPEG format and has to be named like the calendar; so for
    the calendar <i>winter</i> the file has to be <code>winter.jpg</code>. Then
    browse to <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Adventcalendar</i> → <i>Main Settings</i>,
    where you can prepare the image to be the cover of your advent calendar.
    Pressing <i>Prepare Cover</i> will draw the little doors with the according
    day numbers. For images in landscape format there will be 4 rows with 6
    doors each; for images in portrait format there will be 6 rows with 4 doors
    each. The size of the doors and the colors can be customized in the plugin's
    configuration. The order of the doors is chosen randomly; if you don't like
    the chosen order, just prepare the image again.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage-secrets">
<h3>Prepare the Secrets</h3>
<p>
    Create a new CMSimple_XH page with the name of the advent calendar as
    heading (the menu level of the page doesn't matter). Create a sub page for
    each day (the 1st sub page is for day 1, the 2nd for day 2 etc.) You can
    fill the pages with any contents you like, even plugin calls are possible.
    Typically you will want to <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/cmsimple_scripting#show_in_menu">hide</a>
    all these pages from the menu. If you want to use an already existing page
    as secret behind a door, just <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/cmsimple_scripting#redirect_page">redirect</a>
    the respective sub page to the existing one and append "&amp;print" to the
    URL.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage-display">
<h3>Display the Calendar</h3>
<p>
    Display the advent calendar on any CMSimple_XH page by calling the plugin:
</p>
<pre>{{{adventcalendar('name_of_the_calendar')}}}</pre>
<p>
    Of course <i>name_of_the_calendar</i> must be replaced with the actual name
    of your advent calendar.
